# Anomaly Detection for Failing Servers
 
This project implements an anomaly detection algorithm from scratch to automatically detect failing servers on a network by analzying server throughput (in mb/s) and latency (in ms) using a Gaussian Distribution. This algorithm is then applied to a higher dimensional dataset with 11 features.
